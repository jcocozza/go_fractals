## Building Fractals with Iterated Function Systems

The CLI tool revolves around the user generated file (you can call it whatever you like when you pass it into the CLI).

Here's what a sample file, `ifs.txt`, looks like:
```
[2,2][.5,0,0,.5] + [2,1][0,0]
[2,2][-.5,0,0,.5] + [2,1][1,0]
[2,2][.5,0,0,-.5] + [2,1][0,1]
[2,2][.25,0,0,.25] + [2,1][.75,.75]
```

Each newline represents a new transformation in the system. Information about the transformation is encoded in the following way:

```
[2,2][.5,0,0,.5] + [2,1][0,0] ->
[number_of_rows, number_of_columns][similiarity_matrix] + [number_of_rows, number_of_columns][shift_matrix]
```

So, if we look at `[2,2][.5,0,0,.5], we see this is a 2x2 matrix.` When ordering elements of the matrix, start in the first row, and go across columns, then go tho the second row and so on.

So the the identity matrix:
```
[ 1 0 ]
[ 0 1 ]
```

Is represented as `[2,2][1,0,0,1]`.

Note that shifts should always have a `number_of_columns = 1`, since you are simply moving the points.

## Example

Here are several ways to generate the barnsley fern which is represented by the following IFS:

```
[2,2][0,0,0,.16] + [2,1][0,0]
[2,2][.85,0.04,-.04,.85] + [2,1][0,1.6]
[2,2][0.2,-.26,.23,.22] + [2,1][0,1.6]
[2,2][-.15,.28,.26,.24] + [2,1][0,.44]
```

The deterministic algorithm:
1) `go_fractals ifs -p examples/barnsley_fern_ifs.txt --algo-d -n 13`

The probabilistic algorithm:

2) `go_fractals ifs -p examples/barnsley_fern_ifs.txt --algo-p -n 67108864`

The probabilistic algorithm with custom probabilities for each transformation (This will do a better job of adding the stem compared to the probabilistic algorithm alone):

3) `go_fractals ifs -p examples/barnsley_fern_ifs.txt --algo-p -n 67108864 --probabilities .1,.67,.115,.115`

And here it is:

## .stl files:

### Stacks

Stacks are a pain to do properly, and I currently do not have the 3D skills to properly do them.
Right now what the "stacks" are, are a set of 2-D points (the fractal) and an identical set of points shifted into 3-D space.
Then we just connect the corresponding points.

This way of doing things is not feasible for 3-D printing because we're not actually creating surfaces, just a whole bunch of parallel lines organized in a way that makes the fractal look 3-D. The printers aren't smart enough to know the thing is a very good approximation of a 3D object.

Here's an example of a .stl produced by the stack maker:

## Videos

You can also generate videos of fractals developing:

## Random Fractals

This did not work out the way I expected and need refinement. Currently, you rarely get anything interesting.
Most of the time they aren't fractals in the rigorous sense.

## A full suite - The maple fractal:
```
[2,2][.15,0,0,.5] + [2,1][-.125,-1]
[2,2][.4,.4,-.5,.5] + [2,1][1.2,-.75]
[2,2][.4,-.4,.5,.5] + [2,1][-1.4,-.73]
[2,2][.5,0,0,.5] + [2,1][.01,1.5]
```

### Deterministic
```
$ go_fractals ifs -p maple.ifs --algo-d -n 11
Total number of points: 4194304

# Julia Sets

Using the escape time algorithm `go_fractals` also provides the ability to build Julia sets.

## Usage

There are two julia commands, a regular julia set and julia parameter evolution.

```
$ go run . julia --help
Pass in a complex function for the julia set

Usage:
  go_fractals julia [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --color             [OPTIONAL] Default Grey Scale
  -e, --equation string   [REQUIRED] The equation for your julia set
  -F, --fileName string   [REQUIRED] The file name in the downloads folder
  -h, --help              help for julia
```

```
$ go run . julia-evolve --help
Create a video or 3d stl of the julia set evolving through parameter space

Usage:
  go_fractals julia-evolve [flags]

Flags:
  -i, --complexIncrement string   [REQUIRED] Set the increment for the evolution of the parameter
  -e, --equation string           [REQUIRED] The parameterized equation for your julia set
  -F, --fileName string           [REQUIRED] The file name in the downloads folder
  -f, --fps int                   [OPTIONAL] The framerate of the video. (default 10)
  -h, --help                      help for julia-evolve
  -p, --initialComplex string     [REQUIRED] Set the intial parameter for a julia evolution
  -n, --numIncrements int         [REQUIRED] the number of evolution steps to take (default 10)
  -d, --threeDim                  [OPTIONAL] Create a 3d stl file of the evolution
```

### Equations
The basis for julia sets are the equations you use to build them. I don't have a particularly sophisticated equation parser, but essentially what happens is that your equation will be converted into a golang function. When passing them into the CLI, you need to use golang syntax: `z*z - 2` is the equation `z^2 - 2`.

(Although I haven't tested, theoretically, any function of a complex variable will be viable if it is in golang code. So
`cmplx.Cos(z) + 2i` could theoretically work.)

When creating a regular julia set, you must use `z` as the function's variable. (this is a consequence of how the parser is built)

When creating julia evolutions, `z` is the function variable and `c` is the parameter that will be evolved. For example, `z*z - c`.

### Regular Julia Set

`$ go_fractals julia -e "1/(z*z + .72i)" -F example`

![image](./examples/julia/example.png)

### Julia Evolution

An evolution associated with the above's fractal set:
`$ go_fractals julia-evolve -e "1/(z*z + c)" -f 10 -p "0-0.63i" -n 100 -i "0-0.001i" -F example`

What this represents is the evolution through parameter space from:
`1/(z*z + -0.63i)` â‡’ `1/(z*z + -.73i)` in increments of `0.001`.
